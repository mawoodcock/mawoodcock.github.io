The desktop is not dead. In fact, I find myself needing one more than ever in different capacities. Modern notebook computers are amazing pieces of technology, but for certain tasks they fall short. I, myself, have found that for long work sessions keyboards and screen sizes on notebooks cause overdue stress to my eyes and wrists. It is almost impossible to maintain good posture for extended periods. 

A few months ago, I had a conversation with my wife that led to the decision to acquire a desktop computer for the house. It was a combination of personal finance and the ability to help children with online learning resources and homework. The biggest problem when trying to get a basic computer for our house seemed to be price. Between $300 and $400 the selections were pretty limited. We found a few refurbished options that may have worked. When compared to the DIY options at that price it was hard to justify buying anything from a large manufacturer at that price. Another factor was the ability to clean the PC and replace any parts that might go bad in the future, thus squeezing out as much extra life from the PC as possible in a few years. 

<< Insert something about repairability >>

To build something with decent performance at a budget, I looked to YouTube for budget PC gaming builds. After all, if a DIY budget PC could run Fortnite at decent settings, I was certain it could run Quicken and some web apps! There are loads of tutorials and guides for building your first budget PC on the web so I would need to compare and contrast to find the best for my budget. I had known for some time that AMD had done something different in recent years by adding graphical processing into their CPUs and had significantly lowered the price for a PC with decent processing power and graphics handling that was pretty darn good. 

So settling on the AMD chip as the brain of the new PC, I set out to find the components to match. I would want a case that was roomy enough to work in and provided decent airflow. Size and aesthetics were not a big concern as the PC would live under a desk. After these two factors were set, I went about filling in the blanks. I was working with a budget of around $300 which led to a balancing act of finding the right parts at the right price. I ended up with two separate purchases, one from Newegg and the other from Amazon. 

The parts arrived within the same week and I prepared for the build. 

If you have never assembled a PC from components before, it can be a daunting task. The devil is in the details. The fact I was working on such a budget worked to my advantage in this case. There was no need to measure to make sure everything fit or worry that the motherboard would not be oriented in the correct way was not a concern. If the research is done up front, everything should be smooth sailing. My process went something like this: Chose CPU (APU in my case), choose case, choose motherboard compatible with said CPU and sized to fit the case, pick RAM compatible with motherboard, pick power supply to sufficiently power all components with some extra for future upgrades and make sure it fit the case as well. 

All told, the build took around 45 minutes which included spending time showing our oldest how everything went together. The components went together easily. First placing the CPU on the motherboard and installing the RAM. Then placing the motherboard inside the case, and finally adding power and connecting everything up. 

Next came the part every PC builder knows, flipping the switch for the first time. You take a deep breath and flip the switch. My first few times building, I flipped the switchâ€¦. and nothing. Not this time, the lights started blinking, the fans started whirring and the screen lit up. Success!
