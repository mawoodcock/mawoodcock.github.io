I started, many years ago now, looking for a more ergonomic and efficient way to type. I had been programming for 4-5 years and I was starting to get pain in my wrist and thumbs from both poor typing habits, bad posture and apple chicklet-style keyboards. I am a fairly large individual and my hands have always felt a bit heavy for the ‘modern’ Apple style keyboards. 

I wanted something heavy, sturdy and you could possible use in a defense situation if the need should arise. I wanted the old school 40 pound IBM style keyboard that I had grown up typing on. Or so I thought at the time. I tried to find one but they were pretty beat, ugly and old. So after a little Internet perusing I found a company called WASD Keyboards. Not knowing it at the time, I had just taken the first step into a fathomless world of custom mechanical keyboards.

The first board I purchased was a full 104 keys with Cherry MX blue switches and some abs keycaps. I was super excited and had it delivered to straight to my work, where I did most of my heavy coding. A week later, after thoroughly pissing off my officemates, it found a new spot in my basement workshop/man cave. Here it could do no harm poor unsuspecting ear drums.

Back to the shallow key travels of an Apple keyboard I went. Until one day I was trouble shooting a problem and ended up on stack overflow, the Mecha of coding knowledge on the web. While looking through an article on looping through a python script, I saw an ad for a collaboration between one of the founders of Stack Overflow and WASD Keyboards. Whaaat? So I clicked. The Code Keyboard was an all black no frills, quieter, office friendly keyboard, designed by one of the best known coders on the planet. So, I sold my first WASD board to a coworker for gaming use and got in line to buy the answer to my typing problems. 

That is where the story ended, for a year or two. The Cherry MX clear switches and big thick case dampened the noise considerably and the MX Clear switches were springy and great for my personal typing style. One thing that I did not notice during this time is while my typing posture and habits had improved my neck was beginning to get sore. I realized it was now my mouse that was giving me the problem. It was so far to the right of my hands, and while I try not to use the mouse it was difficult and there was limited space on my desk.
